```{r}
library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
ev_data = read.csv("ev_adoption_data.csv")
head(ev_data)

split = sample.split(ev_data$total_ev_count, SplitRatio = 0.8)

# training data
ev_train = subset(ev_data, split==TRUE)

# testing data
ev_test = subset(ev_data, split == FALSE)

#scatterplot
cor(subset(ev_train, select = -c(ZIPCODE,AVG_HHSZ_OWNER,AVG_HHSZ_RENTER,TP_SEX_RATIO, TP_MED_AGE,TP_18Y_OVR_SXRATIO, TP_65Y_OVR_SXRATIO) ))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
